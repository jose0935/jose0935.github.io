<p style="color: gray; font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: white;">3. Uses made of your Personal Information</span><br>

In this section, we set out the purposes for which we use Personal Information that we collect via our website and, in compliance with our obligations under European law, identify the “legal grounds” on which we rely to process the information.<br><br>

These “legal grounds” are set out in European Data Protection Law, which allows companies to process personal data only when the processing is permitted by the specific “legal grounds” set out in law<br><br>

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.<br><br>

Please note that in addition to the disclosures we have identified below, we may disclose Personal Information for the purposes we explain in this notice to service providers, contractors, agents, advisors (e.g. legal, financial, business or other advisors) and affiliates of Razer that perform activities on our behalf, as well as other members of the Razer group.<br><br>

Where required by law, we will ask for your consent at the time we collect your data to conduct any of these types of marketing. We will provide an option on the appropriate platform to unsubscribe or opt-out of further communication on any electronic marketing communication sent to you.<br><br>

(e) <span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">To monitor certain activities ►</span> to monitor queries and transactions to ensure service quality, compliance with procedures, terms of use and policies (including our Razer Insider House Rules), and to combat fraud (including running anti-fraud checks against your payment method when processing your order(s) on our website);<br><br>

<span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">Use justifications:</span> contract performance, legal obligations, legal claims, legitimate interests (to ensure that the quality and legality of our services)<br><br>

(e) <span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">To reorganise or make changes to our business ►</span> in the event that we: (i) are subject to negotiations for the sale of our business or part thereof to a third party; (ii) are sold to a third party; or (iii) undergo a re-organisation, we may need to transfer some or all of your Personal Information to the relevant third party (or its advisors) as part of any due diligence process for the purpose of analysing any proposed sale or re-organisation. We may also need to transfer your Personal Information to that re-organised entity or third party after the sale or reorganisation for them to use for the same purposes as set out in this policy<br><br>

<span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">Use justifications:</span> legitimate interests (in order to allow us to change our business)<br><br>

(f) <span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">In connection with legal or regulatory obligations ►</span> We may process your Personal Information to comply with our regulatory requirements or dialogue with regulators as applicable which may include disclosing your Personal Information to third parties, the court service and/or regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with enquiries, proceedings or investigations by such parties anywhere in the world or where compelled to do so. Where permitted, we will direct any such request to you or notify you before responding unless to do so would prejudice the prevention or detection of a crime.<br><br>

<span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">Use justifications:</span> legal obligations, legal claims, legitimate interests (to cooperate with law enforcement and regulatory authorities)<br><br></p>

<p style="color: gray; font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: white;">4. Profiling and Automated Decision Making</span><br>
The advertisements and recommendations (including online, while you are logged into your Razer ID account, and while you are using our mobile app) which we show you are chosen by analysing the Personal Information you provide to us as described in section 2, including information about your past purchases from us, the way in which you use our products and/or services, and previous advertisements which you have clicked on. To choose advertisements which are tailored and most likely to be of interest to you, we compile and analyse information received from all our customers to gain a better understanding of your preferences from customers similar to you.<br><br>

We use similar predictive techniques to combat payment fraud, as described below:<br><br>

<span style="color: white;">Processing of payments on our site</span><br><br>

(a) When you submit a payment request on our site (including when making purchases from our online store, or when purchasing zGold or zSilver), we pass your payment information (including information about your past transactions, the current transaction, your Razer ID, credit card details and IP address) to a third party service provider (Cashshield <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">http://www.cashshield.com</span>) which conducts anti-fraud checks on our behalf. Cashshield analyses this data using its own algorithm, and you should consult their privacy policy for more details (<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">http://www.cashshield.com/privacy</span>). Our online store merely queries whether the payment information provided by you satisfies the criteria set by Cashshield’s algorithm and then returns back the results. If your payment information does not satisfy Cashshield’s criteria, the payment request is declined.<br><br>

This process may result in you not being able to complete a purchase on our site. You may want to check your payment information, or try again using a different method of payment.<br><br>

Otherwise, you may request that we provide information about our decision-making methodology and ask us to verify that the automated decision has been made correctly. We may reject the request, as permitted by applicable law, including when providing the information would result in a disclosure of a trade secret or would interfere with the prevention or detection of fraud or other crime but generally in these circumstances we will ask Cashshield to verify that its algorithm and source data are functioning as anticipated without error or bias.<br><br></p>

<p style="color: gray; font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: white;">5. Sharing your Personal Information (and transfers outside of the EEA)</span><br>

We will only use or disclose your Personal Information for the purpose(s) it was collected and as otherwise identified in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

<span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">Sharing outside the Razer group:</span> Personal Information may be provided to third parties, including anti-fraud organisations, legal, regulatory or law enforcement authorities in cases of suspected criminal activity or contravention of law, for the detection and prevention of fraud, or when required to satisfy the legal or regulatory requirements of governments, regulatory authorities or other self-regulatory organizations, or to comply with a court order or for the protection of our assets (for example, collection of overdue accounts).<br><br>

Sharing within the Razer group: We may share your Personal Information within the Razer group, including locations outside of the European Economic Area where we do business, for marketing purposes, for legal and regulatory purposes, to manage credit risk and other business risks, to perform analytics, to ensure we have correct or up to date information about you (such as your current address or date of birth) and to better manage your relationship with us.<br><br>

<span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">Business sale or reorganisation:</span> Over time, we may buy new businesses or sell some of our businesses. Accordingly, Personal Information associated with any accounts, products or services of the business being purchased or sold will be reviewed as part of the due diligence process and subsequently transferred as a business asset to the new business owner. We may also transfer Personal Information as part of a corporate reorganisation or other change in corporate control.<br><br>

<span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">Sub-contractors and agents:</span> We may use affiliates or other companies to provide services on our behalf such as data processing, account administration, fraud prevention and detection, analytics and marketing. Such companies will be given only the Personal Information needed to perform those services and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes. We have contracts in place holding these companies to the same standards of confidentiality by which we are governed.<br><br>

<span style="color: #888; font-weight: bold;">Transfers outside of the EEA:</span> Your Personal Information may be accessed by staff, suppliers or other persons in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EEA. We will, in all circumstances, safeguard personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>
Where we transfer Personal Information from inside the European Economic Area (the EEA) to outside the EEA, we may be required to take specific additional measures to safeguard the relevant Personal Information. Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export Personal Information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals (see the full list here <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm</span>), we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.<br><br></p>

<p style="color: gray; font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: white;">6. Security of your Personal Information</span><br>

We use physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, access, modification, destruction, disclosure, loss or theft of your Personal Information in our custody or control.<br><br>

We have agreements and controls in place with third party service providers requiring that any information we provide to them must be safeguarded and used only for the purpose of providing the service we have requested the company to perform.<br><br>

<span style="color: white;">Security over the Internet</span><br><br>

No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.<br><br>

All information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors’ secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.<br><br>

<span style="color: white;">Retention of your Personal Information</span><br><br>

Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When Personal Information is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymised information) or securely destroy the data.<br><br></p>

<p style="color: gray; font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: white;">7. Your rights & contacting us
Marketing</span><br>

Most of our processing is permitted by “legal grounds” other than consent (see section 2 above). In relation to Direct Marketing, where we are required to do so, we will obtain your consent before using your Personal Information for this purpose. If you prefer not to receive our Direct Marketing communications and/or not have your Personal Information shared among the members of the Razer group for the purpose of marketing, you can have your name deleted from our Direct Marketing and/or shared information lists. <br>
Direct Marketing means our communication with you such as mail, telemarketing or email, using your contact information, to inform you about products and services that we think may be of interest and value to you. This does not include communications regarding products or services that you currently have, including improved ways to use the products, or additional features of the products as well as transactional information.<br><br>

<span style="color: white;">Updating information</span><br><br>

We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate. In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the Personal Information that you have provided to us by contacting us as set out in the “Contacting Us” section below.<br><br>

<span style="color: white;">Your rights</span><br><br>

If you have any questions in relation to our use of your Personal Information, you should first contact us as per the “Contacting Us” section below. Under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to:<br><br>

(a) provide you with further details on the use we make of your information;<br><br>

(b) provide you with a copy of information that you have provided to us;<br><br>

(c) update any inaccuracies in the Personal Information we hold;<br><br>

(d) delete any Personal Information the we no longer have a lawful ground to use;<br><br>
